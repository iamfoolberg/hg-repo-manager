This is a local cache manager for [KohakuHub](https://github.com/KohakuBlueleaf/KohakuHub)).

I can't find a way to cache the downloaded files in KohakuHub, 
this manager is created (mostly by https://chatglm.cn/ AI) to download models from ModelScope and upload to KohakuHub.

It's not full tested and use it on your own risk.
